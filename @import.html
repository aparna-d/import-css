        The Amazon rainforest, covering much of northwestern Brazil and extending into Colombia, 
        Peru and other South American countries, is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, famed for its biodiversity. 
        It’s crisscrossed by thousands of rivers, including the powerful Amazon. River towns, with 19th-century architecture from rubber-boom days,
         include Brazil’s Manaus and Belém and Peru’s Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado. The Amazon rainforest, alternatively, the Amazon jungle
          or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. 
          This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. 
          This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories.
